# Project Brief

## Overview
Cyberk DApp is a decentralized application (DApp) designed for Cyberk company members. The application aims to display rewards in the form of $CBK tokens as a portfolio, encouraging Cyberk members to actively use the application. It also provides features such as asset details viewing, transaction history, $CBK to USDT swapping (and vice versa) based on smart contract rates, member management (admin only), and a skill badge system following a roadmap.

## Core Requirements
- Display member rewards in $CBK tokens as a portfolio
- Implement token economics with $CBK token
- Provide asset management features for members
- Enable token swapping between $CBK and USDT
- Implement member management system for admins
- Create skill badge system with gamification elements
- Ensure secure and private handling of member information
- Support Google and Metamask authentication

## Project Goals
1. Retain employees through $CBK token and gamification mechanics
2. Recognize member contributions through NFT Badges
3. Provide intuitive interface for tracking $CBK assets and rewards
4. Motivate members through reward display and skill development roadmap
5. Offer tools for $CBK asset management, including USDT swapping
6. Support administrators in member management and reward distribution
