## Recent Changes (Latest First)

### Authentication System Enhancement (Latest)
- Updated LoginForm.tsx with improved error handling
  - Added comprehensive HTTP status code handling (400, 401, 422, 429)
  - Improved toast notifications format
  - Better validation error display
  - Removed hardcoded URLs
  
- Enhanced AuthContext.tsx
  - Added proper token management
  - Implemented automatic user data fetching
  - Added logout API integration
  - Improved error handling and state cleanup
  - Added TypeScript type safety improvements

### Server Setup
- Frontend server running on http://localhost:8080
- Backend server configured for http://localhost:3000
- API routes structured for authentication endpoints

## Known Issues
1. Backend Environment Configuration
   - Missing database configuration variables
   - Need to set up proper .env file with:
     - DATABASE_TYPE
     - DATABASE_HOST
     - DATABASE_PORT
     - DATABASE_PASSWORD
     - DATABASE_NAME
     - DATABASE_USERNAME

2. Frontend-Backend Integration
   - API endpoints need to be standardized
   - CORS configuration may need adjustment

## Current Focus
1. ðŸ”„ Resolving backend database configuration issues
2. ðŸ”„ Setting up proper environment variables
3. ðŸ”„ Testing and debugging authentication flow
4. ðŸ”„ Implementing proper error boundaries

## Next Steps
1. Set up proper database configuration
2. Complete backend environment setup
3. Test full authentication flow
4. Add user profile management
5. Implement session management
6. Add password reset functionality

## Technical Debt
1. Need to implement proper test coverage
2. API documentation needs to be created
3. Error handling needs to be standardized across the application
4. Loading states need to be implemented consistently

## Notes
- Frontend development environment is working as expected
- Backend requires proper environment configuration before proceeding
- Authentication system has been significantly improved but needs testing
- Need to maintain consistency in API endpoint naming and structure
